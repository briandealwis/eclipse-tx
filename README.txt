This package is a set of Eclipse plugins that I've written over the
years to help build and code in Eclipse. 

ca.mt.wbspies: a set of spies into the workings of the Eclipse Workbench.
  It provides a Selection view, showing details about the current
  selection in the workbench.  It also provides event loggers that
  dump SWT events and Command execution events to stdout, toggled
  through the Window menu.
